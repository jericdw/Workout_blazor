# Workout blazor

Greetings! This code repository is an initial attempt to use .NET MAUI framework to develop a workout app that can be available for Android and iOS.

This code attempts to use SQLite for a local database on the platform to record and track progress. There are too many similar apps out there, so this version is open source of any want to further this project for personal use. 

The goal of this project is to have a simple interface to where data bindings to the user interface can read/write/edit/ delete and sort exercise data. 

My current obstacles revolve around dependency injection on the user interface in addition to normal page navigation. 

If you are experienced as a dotnet developer, I'll ask for recommendations as I'm a hobbyist with other fulltime responsibilities. 

If you are new to this environment, feel free to learn with me. Any thoughts, comments are appreciated!

Update: I had not come across this presentation, but I am placing it here given it answers majority of the questions I had in this ReadMe section.

Modifying the code structure to match is my current direction...
